        <p>My boss had a problem. Housing policy leads were blocking ideas to build more homes. He was meeting them
          tomorrow; could
          I help? Next day, my presentation turned the situation around; I’m a <strong className="shimmer openStrategist"

        </p>
        <p>I grasp the root cause of a
          problem,
          embrace uncertainty, and compare solutions. I need to understand holistically and flip between viewpoints.
          I
          overcome
          entrenched beliefs, posing problematic questions.

          Computers
          enabled me to write. I won ‘best new play’ in
          the
          Southend
          Drama festival and achieved three readings at the National Theatre. My screenplays attracted consideration
          from
          producers,
          directors and performers including Jack Shepherd, and Patrick Allen.</p>
        <p> I moved to London to train as an
          actor, with a
          talent for improvisation and directing; I performed in Fringe Theatre, short films, and TV.</p>

        <p>Acting & writing taught me psychology, motivations, biases, beliefs, incentives, and interactions. I
          plunge
          into
          research for every new encounter.</p>
        <p> When diagnosed Dyslexic at HMT, I
          accelerated my reading, digesting over
          400
          audio-books: Strategy, Economics, Philosophy, Psychology, Business, Sales, Communication, Marketing,
          Statistics, Science…no limits.</p>
        <p> Technology increased my reading and writing speed, and I developed expertise
          in critical
          thinking and problem solving, by relentless, eclectic learning.
